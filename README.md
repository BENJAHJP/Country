# Country

Country App 
This is an app that fetches country data from an Api and displays it in a scrollable column and alows user to read the descriptions, seacrh and filter data

I used Retrofit library and coil, iused retrofit to fetch data from the api since retrofit is fast and it is well documented, i used coil to display images from the network since coil is well documented and easy to intergrate

I faced  the challenges of parsing data from one screen to another but after research i used parceable class to parse the data

If i had time i would add more data on the details screen and also support more languages and improve the ui
